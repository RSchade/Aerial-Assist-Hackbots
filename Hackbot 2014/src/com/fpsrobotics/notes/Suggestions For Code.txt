Suggestions for Code
Hackbots:
	3) Autonomous:
		a) Look at "AutonomousSuggested"

Drive Train:
	1) Look at comments
	2) WAY TO COMPLICATED THAN WHAT WE NEED:
		You say in SEVEN classes what can be said in TWO
		I spent 45 MINUTES trying to read the drive train files
		Goal of Programming: Do as much as possible with the least lines of code
		Look at "DriveTrainThreadSuggestedA" and "DriveTrainThreadSuggestedB"
	3) Functions of Drive Train as seen by me:
		a) Set Speed
		b) Get Speed
		c) Stop
		d) Gear Shifter (manual/ auto)
Hackbot Station:
	1) Figure out which values you would want to output to Dashboard
	2) See Added Comment Sections
Catapult:
	1) Look at "CatapultSuggestedA" and "CatapultSuggestedB"
