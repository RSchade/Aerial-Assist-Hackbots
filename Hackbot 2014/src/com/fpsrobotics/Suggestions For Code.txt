Suggestions for Code
Hackbots:
	1) Watchdog:
		a) You have inputting into parameters as well as inside the class: "Department of Redundancy Department"
		b) Just have inside the "Hackbot Watchdog Class"
	2) Look at added comments of "Hackbot Station"
	3) Autonomous:
		a) Look at "AutonomousSuggested"
	4) Disabled:
		a) Add: "disable()" method to hackbotWatch 
		b) Move things to "disabledInit"

Drive Train:
	1) Look at comments
	2) WAY TO COMPLICATED THAN WHAT WE NEED:
		You say in SEVEN classes what can be said in TWO
		I spent 45 MINUTES trying to read the drive train files
		Goal of Programming: Do as much as possible with the least lines of code
		Look at "DriveTrainThreadSuggestedA" and "DriveTrainThreadSuggestedB"
	3) Functions of Drive Train as seen by me:
		a) Set Speed
		b) Get Speed
		c) Stop
		d) Gear Shifter (manual/ auto)
Hackbot Station:
	1) Figure out which values you would want to output to Dashboard
	2) See Added Comment Sections
SpinnySticks:
	1) I'd just say "spinnyMotor.set(x)" and spinnySolenoid.set(y)"
Catapult:
	1) Look at "CatapultSuggestedA" and "CatapultSuggestedB"
